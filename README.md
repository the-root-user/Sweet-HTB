Hey, wait.. there's more!<br>
There's a file `Dark-Reader-Settings-HTB.json` in this repo. After installing the [Dark Reader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/) add-on in Firefox or any other browser, import the settings from this file into the add-on and enjoy the same dark mode as HTB on almost all other websites on the internet!
