Inspired from the UI of [Hackthebox](https://app.hackthebox.eu)

Yes, simple as that.<br>
Enjoy :)

But, wait.. there's more!<br>
There's this file [Dark-Reader-Settings-HTB.json](Dark-Reader-Settings-HTB.json) in the repo. After installing the [Dark Reader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/) add-on in Firefox or any other browser, import the settings from this file into the add-on and enjoy the same dark mode as HTB on almost all other websites on the internet! TryHackMe is already in there :)
