Sweet theme for Sweet Hackers

Based on the awesome [WhiteSur](https://github.com/vinceliuice/WhiteSur-kde) theme by Vinceliuice<br>
Inspired from the UI of [Hackthebox](https://app.hackthebox.eu)

But, wait.. there's more!<br>
There's this file [Dark-Reader-Settings-HTB.json](Dark-Reader-Settings-HTB.json) in the repo, which can make light looking sites like [this](dark-reader.png).<br>
After installing the [Dark Reader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/) add-on in your browser of choice, import the settings from this file into the add-on and enjoy the same dark mode as HTB on almost all other websites on the internet!<br>
<!-- TryHackMe is already in there. They have got there own dark mode now. -->

That's all. Keep hacking ðŸ’š
